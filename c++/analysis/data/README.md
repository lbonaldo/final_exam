This **analysis/data** folder collects all the data obtained from the runs on Ulysses with some **scripts** which have been used to get the **averages** and the **errors** according to the following steps:

- **python.sh**: bash script to divide the data according to the different types of tree;

- **average_dev.ipynb**: jupyter-notebooks that creates the txt-files with three columns: dimension, average, and error. 

The **analysis.py** script is just a module with the functions used in the notebook. All the obtained files were plotted using three jupyter-notebooks which can be found in the **analysis/plot** folder.
